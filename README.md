# The-Storyteller-s-Revenge

This is a project which depicts a traveler with a friend at the Grand Canyon testing the echo of the mountains. In the video, they are fascinated by the echo they hear from the canyon and mountain range so they try different tactics to provoke it. GVR SDK 1.0.3. was used, Pix Pro 360, Adobe Premiere, AV Pro workaround (with watermark) and Unity AV Player.

__Development Process__

I began with downloading Jessica's videos from Dropbox and by researching some of her Grand Canyon which I liked. Then I stitched two 180 videos using Pix Pro 360 software in order to ingest into Adobe Premiere. A title and an official credit section were added. 

__User Testing__

I launched the Unity app I created on my LG Nexux Android smartphone and put it into a cardboard viewer. The non-edited 50 second long video was clear and had a smooth transition between character movements.
