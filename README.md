# The-Storyteller-s-Revenge

This is a project which depicts a traveler going around the world with a friend at the Grand Canyon testing the echo of the mountains. GVR SDK 1.0.3. was used, Pix Pro 360, Adobe Premiere, AV Pro workaround (with watermark) and Unity AV Player.

__Development Process__

I began with downloading Jessica's videos from Dropbox and by researching some of her Grand Canyon which I liked. Then I stitched two 180 videos using Pix Pro 360 software in order to ingest into Adobe Premiere. A title and an official credit section were added.
