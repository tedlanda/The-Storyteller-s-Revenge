# The-Storyteller-s-Revenge

This is a project in which two 180 videos were stitched together using Pix Pro 360 basic software to create a 360 video of a traveler riding with a friend in a rickshaw in the streets of India. The video is roughly three minutes long and is imported into Unity with GVR SDK 1.0.3.

__Development Process__

I began with downloading Jessica's videos from Dropbox and by researching some of her Grand Canyon which I liked. Then I stitched two 180 videos using Pix Pro 360 software in order to ingest into Adobe Premiere.
