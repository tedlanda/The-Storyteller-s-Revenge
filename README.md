# The-Storyteller-s-Revenge

This is a project which depicts a traveler going around the world showcasing the kind of life I have always wanted to have but couldn't achieve. GVR SDK 1.0.3. was used, as well as Pix Pro 360 video stitching software.

__Development Process__

I began with downloading Jessica's videos from Dropbox and by researching some of her Grand Canyon which I liked. Then I stitched two 180 videos using Pix Pro 360 software in order to ingest into Adobe Premiere.
